            <p class="focus">As i determined to be a front end developer. I enrolled myself in jhankar mahbub's
                course.The reason
                behind
                of
                enrolling is, he is a such well organised instructor and the whole team behind him are admireable
                also. I hope i will become a front end developer and at the end of this year, i can introduce my self as
                a
                developer,also i can ensure a job for myself. Just be focused and don't be depressed. You know,you can
                win, just
                focus on each n every day works,it will end up to give you,your dream destination. Bravo
